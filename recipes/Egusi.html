    <p>
      Egusi Soup is an outstandingly delicious, quick, and easy soup with ground egusi seeds, similar to pumpkin seeds. 
      This meaty, nutty, spicy soup is protein-packed and full of tasty greens.

        <li>1 teaspoon Scotch bonnet pepper, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup palm oil</li>
        <li>2 cups ground egusi seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crayfish powder</li>
        <li>3 Maggi cube</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon iru</li>
        <li>2 quarts chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 pound goat shoulder, cube</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oi</li>
        <li>2 cups pumpkin leaf or spinach, strained dry</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
          In a large saucepan, over medium heat, sweat the onion, garlic, tomatoes, ginger, 
          and Scotch bonnet pepper in the palm oil until vegetables are translucent, about 10 minutes. 
          Add the egusi seeds and toast in oil for 10 minutes. Add crayfish powder, Maggi, 
          iru, and chicken stock and simmer for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, in a separate pan, over high heat, season the goat meat with salt and sear in canola oil until browned on all sides, about 7 minutes. 
          Add the goat meat to the egusi mixture and simmer together for about an hour, or until the meat is tender.
          Add the pumpkin leaves during the last 20 minutes of cooking. The sauce should be thick and most of the liquid should have simmered off. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Season to taste with salt. Serve with fufu or pounded yam.
        </li>
    </ol>
